                    <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) from Winchester, MA. 

One of the main reasons I decided to attend WPI is due to their – undergraduate robotics engineering program. With my background in robotics from high school, I 
Through the robotics program at my high school, I found a passion for completing robot challenges 

In my free time, I enjoy staying active, traveling, and spending time with my friends and family. I’ve grown up playing sports my entire life, including taekwondo, volleyball, and cross country. One of my greatest fitness accomplishments is earning my second-degree black belt in taekwondo. I like to take advantage of my close commute to the city by frequently taking local trips to Boston. One of my proudest accomplishments was when my family and I rebuilt our outdoor patio when we had extra time during the pandemic.
